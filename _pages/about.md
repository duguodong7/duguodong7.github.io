<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello there! I'm Guodong Du, currently a research assistant at [Knowledge and Language Computing Lab](http://www.li-jing.com/team.html) @Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen).
Prior to joining HITSZ, I was a research intern and master student in [Learning and Vision Lab](http://lv-nus.org) @National University of Singapore, advised by Professor¬†[Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/) and [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/).  Besides, I had been working as an intern in the area of low level computer vision, mentored by [Xueyi Zou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ua28KoAAAAJ&hl=en), in [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home), Shenzhen, China.

My research interest includes knowledge transfer, fusion and compression, multimodal, heuristic algorithms, spiking neural networks and low level computer vision.

[Parameter Competition Balancing for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02396)

**Guodong Du**, Junlin Lee, Jing Li, Hanting Liu, Runhua Jiang, Shuyang Yu, Yifei Guo, Sim Kuan Goh, Ho-Kin Tang, Min Zhang 

- We re-examine existing model merging methods, emphasizing the critical importance of parameter competition awareness, and introduce PCB-Merging, which effectively adjusts parameter coefficients by balancing parameter competition.

**Guodong Du**, Jing Li, Hanting Liu, Runhua Jiang, Shuyang Yu, Yifei Guo, Sim Kuan Goh, Ho-Kin Tang 

- Model Evolution is the first approach to evolve neural parameters using Differential Evolutionary Algorithms. We introduce a novel knowledge fusion method that evolves language model weights and integrates seamlessly with existing model merging techniques.
