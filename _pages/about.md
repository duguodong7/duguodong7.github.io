Hello there! I'm Guodong Du, currently a research assistant at [Knowledge and Language Computing Lab](http://www.li-jing.com/team.html) @Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen).
Prior to joining HITSZ, I was a research intern and master student in [Learning and Vision Lab](http://lv-nus.org) @National University of Singapore, advised by Professor¬†[Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/) and [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/).  Besides, I had been working as an intern in the area of low level computer vision, mentored by [Xueyi Zou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ua28KoAAAAJ&hl=en), in [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home), Shenzhen, China.

My research interest includes knowledge transfer, fusion and compression, multimodal, heuristic algorithms, spiking neural networks and low level computer vision.
